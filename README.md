# ZOC REXX Samples
This is a list of ZOC REXX Scripting samples. 

REXX is a [well known programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx),
which was originally developed by IBM for use on mainframes.  
[ZOC Terminal](https://www.emtec.com/zoc/index.html) 
is a [ssh-client](https://www.ssh-client.com/explanation-of-ssh-client.html)
and terminal emulator, which uses REXX as its client side scripting language.

The samples in this project are intended to show 
[basic concepts of the REXX language](https://www.emtec.com/zoc/onlinehelp.html?t=10610)
and also how it integrates with ZOC in order to solve typical terminal
related tasks in REXX by using the 
[extensions which ZOC provides](https://www.emtec.com/zoc/onlinehelp.html?t=10855)
to control the communication and the terminal window itself.

The samples start with basic REXX concepts like variables or IF decisions, 
but they also cover topics like sending a command to the remote host
(e.g. a Linux shell on an ssh-connection) and then reading and analyzing 
the response.
