/* REXX */
/* ^^^^^^ REXX programs begin with the comment "REXX" on the first line 
   (today this is a convention, this is no longer strictly required) */

-- this is also a comment (the comment automatically ends at the end of the line)
/* mostly it depends on personal taste, which type of comment you want to use */


/* if you include the following command in the program (i.e. if you remove the comment 
from it), REXX will show each command as it is processed (TRACE I would show even 
more debug information). */
-- TRACE A
